Readme for abc Extensions for nedit
===================================

Overview
--------

Nedit is a highly customizable editor. As it is based on
Motif, it requires an X-Windows environment. Precompiled
binaries or the source code of Nedit are available from

    http://www.nedit.org

The language mode for abctab2ps switches Nedit into a 
comfortable abc editor with the following features:

 - abc syntax highlighting
 - new entries in the Macro main menu, eg.
    o abc - Preview (Alt-c p)
      automatically launches abctab2ps and ghostview/gv;
      if abctab2ps detects erorrs, you can optionally
      jump to the error in the input file!
    o abc - Goto Voice/Bar (Alt-c g)
    o interactive option setting

Installation
------------

Just type
    nedit -import abc.neditmacro

Customization
-------------

If you want to use abcm2ps instead of abctab2ps or if
you want a different postscript viewer than gv, do
the following:

 - Open the Menu
    Preferences->Default Settings->Customize Menus->Macro Menu...

 - In the list box mark "abc - Preview@abc"

 - adjust the variables $psviewer and $abctab2ps
   to your needs

If you want to change the highlighting patterns or colors:

 - Open the Menu
    Preferences->Default Settings->Syntax Highlighting->Recognition Patterns...

 - Choose "abc" in the language mode combo box

 - Fell free to change everything...


Have fun.
