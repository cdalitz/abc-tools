Esperanto Support for abctab2ps
===============================

The python script psesperanto.py adds support for Esperanto characters
in abctab2ps.

Usage
-----

 1) Write the abc file with the "x convention" for the Esperanto special
    chars, i.e. cx, gx, hx, jx, sx, ux.

 2) Process the abc file with abctab2ps, e.g. ("$" is the shell prompt)
    $ abctab2ps -O la-espero.ps la-espero.abc

 3) Process the PS output file with psesperanto.py, e.g.
    $ python psesperanto.py la-espero.ps > la-espero-latin3.ps

Caveat
-------

The script works as follows:

 - the font encoding is changed to ISO 8859-3 (latin 3)
 - all special characters in string literals are translated
   to the corresponding latin3 code

Beware that this has the side effect, that characters specific to latin1
encoding, might no longer print correctly. This means that, at present,
Esperanto text can only be mixed with text in some other languages
that use 8bit characters.

Installation
------------

The script can be used without installation just by passing its filename
to the python interpreter. The script has been tested with python 2.7.

It can be installed by making teh script file executable and copying
it to a diretcor in your $PATH variable, e.g.

   $ chmod 755 psesperanto.py
   $ sudo cp psepseranto.py /usr/local/bin
