tab2abc
-------

tab2abc is a small tool for converting a file in Wayne
Cripps' tab format to abc format.

tab2abc is copyrighted by Christoph Dalitz and can be 
distributed freely under the GNU GPL.


Requirements
------------

tab2abc is a Perl script and requires a Perl version >= 5.0.
If you are not sure about the version installed on your
system, check it out with "perl -v".

On Unix/Linux/MacOS X systems, Perl is shipped with the operating
system.

On Win32 systems you need to install the Perl interpreter
first. Depending on your preferences, you can obtain Perl 
for Win32 from two different places:

a) As part of Cygwin (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/).
   Start the installer from the Cygwin website and choose
   at least "bash" and "perl" in the software selection.
   Then you can start perl scripts directly from the "bash" 
   shell, which is a much more comfortable command interface 
   than the "DOS shell" that is shipped as "cmd.exe" (with 
   Windows NT/2000/XP) or "command.com" (with Windows 95/98/ME).

b) From Active State (http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/).
   In this case you must invoke perl scripts from the "DOS shell".
   In order to faciliate this, the Active State Perl distribution
   contains a program "pl2bat" which puts a DOS-script ("BAT file")
   wrapper around a Perl script.

Version a) is easier to install and use, but version b) is more
interesting if you plan to do more with Perl yourself, because
Active State offers some interesting commercial addons for Perl 
on Win32 and some Perl addons (eg. for manipulating Windows
Registry entries) might be available only for the Active State 
distribution.


Installation
------------

Unix/Linux/MacOS X:

1. Adjust the first line in tab2abc to the full path
   of your perl executable.
   (If you get an error "tab2abc: file or directory not found"
   on the invocation of tab2abc, this line is probably not
   correct.)

2. Copy tab2abc into a directory in your path (eg. /usr/local/bin)
   and make it executable (chmod a+x tab2abc).

3. Copy the man page tab2abc.1 into a man page directory
   (eg. /usr/local/man/man1).

Win32:

If you plan to call tab2abc from the bash shell (part of Cygwin),
you can follow steps 1. and 2. of the Unix installation.

If you are a masochist and insist on using the crappy DOS shell,
do the following:

1. Create a DOS-script "tab2abc.bat" with the command 
   "pl2bat tab2abc". Note that this only works when you are using
   the Active State Perl distribution.

2. Put that DOS script somewhere in your path 
   (eg. C:\Windows or C:\Winnt)


Usage:
------

"tab2abc -?" gives a usage message. If invoked without any
parameter, tab2abc reads from stdin and writes to stdout.

Please consult the man page for details on options and limitations.
On Unix/Linux/MacOS X, simply type "man tab2abc", on Windows you can
consult the html version of the man page, "tab2abc.html".
